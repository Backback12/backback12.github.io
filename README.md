# Low Quality Images
### How did I make the low quality images?
I opened the image in GIMP and set the resolution to 200x266 (3:4 image ratio).
Then I selected ```Image > Mode > Indexed```
and set the ```Maximum Number of Colors``` to **64**. This created a low colour bit depth image in the style I was attempting to recreate.

In the future I could research more about color
saturation in the images as I believe that is the next step to making these images feel more authentic.

- Background blue? XP background?

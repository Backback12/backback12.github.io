# Connor Pagtakhan's Online Portfolio

Hi! I'm Connor and I thought it would be fun to create my online portfolio as a Windows 2000 inspired UI. I like the vibe and it takes me back to when I played Space Cadet Pinball all the time.

# Low Quality Images
### How did I make the low quality images?
I opened the image in GIMP and set the resolution to 200x266 (3:4 image ratio).
Then I selected ```Image > Mode > Indexed```
and set the ```Maximum Number of Colors``` to **64**. This created a low colour bit depth image in the style I was attempting to recreate.

In the future I could research more about color
saturation in the images as I believe that is the next step to making these images feel more authentic.


## OKAY!!!!!! NOW the NEW method:
### Resize Image
  I'm using 4:3 aspect ratio so the dimensions are ```320x240, 114x152, 152x203,``` 
  <br>Another aspect ratio is 3:2, 102x152, 203x305, 254x381
  <br>5:4: 203x254,
  <br>6:5: 254x305

  Idk man you should just standardize it once you find a good size
  <br>like ```300x250``` or something
### Dither!
  In ```GIMP: Colors > Dither```

  ```Dithering Method: Bayer``` (Used in older compressed images)
  ```Bit depth: RGB 565?``` That seems to be good

# Ideas:
- [x] "Last Modified" Section
- [x] Let window take up 90% of the space, not all of it: leave some edges so it looks like a window
- [x] Background blue? XP background?
- [ ] Allow resize on window borders as well (top/bottom/left/right)
- [ ] Help button functionality
- [ ] Add "file structure" lines to the menu
- [ ] Clean HTML structures
- [ ] Clean CSS names 
- [ ] Tidy Javascript functions (into script.js?)
- [ ] Expandable submenu (expands "projects" menu item) Javascript heavy solution
